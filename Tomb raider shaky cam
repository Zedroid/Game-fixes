Late reply but I had this struggle and found the solution just tonight.
Download HxD and open the .exe file of the game (you can locate it through right click on steam and locate local files)
CTRL + F in the editor and choose Hexadecimal search and paste 8B CF E8 05 72 41 00 84 C0 74 1A 56
Locate the 74 byte and replace it with EB
Save the file and on the HxD and Enjoy the game motion Sickness free
